# Go test coverage from external tests

Need ability to get coverage results when testing tools are external, like curl or postman or pytest.

Trying:
* https://husobee.github.io/golang/test/coverage/2015/11/17/external-test-coverage.html
* https://blog.cloudflare.com/go-coverage-with-external-tests/

## How to run

Open 2 terminals
First - `bash ./run-bin.sh`
Second - `bash ./run-tests.sh`
