Experiments, samples, random programming. No reusable code here.

In other words this is a mess of some prototype code, which I've never commit to any repo, but sometimes regret that it was lost, because I did it in `/tmp` or delete just after.
Also I don't want to use gists, because it's hard to search there, no recursive grep.
